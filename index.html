      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This article seeks to analyze several distinct works of cozy horror media in television and film to point out characteristics and establish a network of these attributes to assist in classifying and associating works of “cozy horror” across various entertainment and media mediums. I ask: What shared aesthetic, narrative, and affective characteristics support the emergent subgenre of cozy horror across media? 
        </p>
      <p>	Cozy horror media is naturally subjective – genre designation is historically tricky and slippery, mediated in all cases by factors such as individual taste development, culturally situated interests and awareness of iconography and symbolism, literary allusion and lineage, and formal hybridization. I argue here, however, that the examples presented in this paper and the resulting attribute map provide a strong initial picture of some shared characteristics that might be mapped onto when considering additional works in the subgenre.  
        </p>
      <p>
        This media can be identified by particular aesthetic and narrative choices as outlined in this project. Identifying characteristics might include focus on character relationships and interpersonal care; comfortingly recognizable caricatures of villainy (the monstrous-familiar); adjacency to the spooky, cool, and richly colored aesthetics of autumn and halloween; familiarity of some combination of tone, plot, character archetype, arc, aesthetics, and production elements; etc. These are the kind of movies you want to watch in a pillow fort on a cool, possibly rainy day, a warm beverage of choice, your softest clothes, and candles lighting your environment. I will be evaluating, based on criteria detailed below,
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3718778/"><i>Over the Garden Wall</i> (2014),</a>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10126434/"><i>Scare Me</i> (2020),</a>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162661/"><i>Sleepy Hollow</i> (1999),</a>

    <section id="methodology" class="text-section">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>	I use a literature review to establish this work as a continuation of viewing horror as a multifaceted genre that can serve many different purposes for different groups and individuals, based on existing scholarship that defines horror’s operating modes and features in wildly different ways. The basis of theoretical work in the horror genre of media establishes space for new conceptualizations of the use and purpose of horror in various modes. It also sets a precedent for using characteristics of horror to describe and identify a shared mood, or atmosphere, of horror. Since it is such a variable genre with a wide variety of quantity and quality amongst and within its various established subgenres, the theoretical availability of horror to be applied to such diverse topics and concepts supports further creative and adaptable readings of horror genre works such as the ones considered in this research project. 
        </p>
      <p>I rely on textual analysis of the media examples to identify shared sub genre characteristics of cozy horror, which serve as the data for my network of cozy horror attributes. Textual analysis includes dramaturgical consideration of 1) thematic features of each story - story type, monster type/presence, overarching themes, character and relationship analysis, and consideration of the stakes of the story and 2) aesthetic features of each media artefact - use of color, iconography and symbolism, lighting, sound, gore and visual fx (if present), and pace. These categories constitute a robust understanding of the traits that place these works in conversation with one another as examples of cozy horror media and act as a roadmap for future inclusions in the genre. 
        </p>

      <h2>On Horror Genre Scholarship</h2>
      <p>	The opportunity to establish a cozy mode of horror is supported by variations in academic literature surrounding the function and effect of various types of horror media. Horror has been identified as having the capacity to evoke a wide variety of moods and affects. We can see the diversity of horror’s capabilities as a home-genre even in the space given to its many distinct and overlapping subgenres. When you encounter “horror” you may be interacting with any number of identifiable categories – examples might include the slasher, body horror, folk horror, supernatural, found footage, horror comedy, gothic, psychological, religious, sci-fi, cosmic, fantasy, gore, home invasion, possession, and so many more. Many of these categories are additionally present in the examples used for this research, proving horror’s flexibility and propensity for blurring and bending genre lines. In a landscape of such diverse modes and affective production, the idea that some of these genre works might fit into a “cozy” or comfortable mode should not be surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
        Horror scholars have historically identified characteristics of horror as a whole and specific subgenres and aspects of horror to support and describe notions of a shared mood, or atmosphere, of horror. Scholars have contended with questions about how we identify such disparate material.
        <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc7776m">Clover</a> and <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Monstrous-Feminine-Film-Feminism-Psychoanalysis/Creed/p/book/9780415052597?srsltid=AfmBOoomkQ3uub-viFVvRfvfB-e6pljSxSvTBQeWjc-hkOv9oOoCVnMC">Creed</a> both identify the feminine in horror, and consider how identifying with gendered traits in characters might affect audience experience. Clover in particular focuses on the slasher subgenre in Men, Women, and Chainsaws, while Creed dives into monster studies in The Montrous-Feminine.
        <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2040610X.2019.1692544">Richards</a> considers horror and its relationship to humor through clowning, and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1212758?origin=JSTOR-pdf">Williams</a>contends with the “Body Genres” of melodrama, horror, and pornography (with mentions of clowning, comedy, thrillers, and musicals as adjacent genres).
        <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/queer-horror-film-and-television-9781786721372/">Elliot-Smith</a> and <a href="https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/629171/">Petrocelli</a> both observe queer connections in the horror genre, either highlighting a queer sensibility and content in horror or by positioning the genre itself as queer. These disparate approaches can be used to support both a new lens to breach the genre’s functions and effects, as well as new methods of considering coziness in relation to things such as identification, gender, queerness, genre blurring, and (especially) atmosphere. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many scholars have also attempted to categorize horror as a whole, and this work relies on that range of scholarship for permission to take up space with new conceptualizations of the use and purpose of horror in various modes.
        <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/431308?origin=crossref">Carroll</a> attempts to define horror by observing the intended emotional response of its audience. While Carroll can be criticised for describing horror in too-narrow terms (considering only the ‘monster’ movie as horror), he offers observation of affective response as a replacement for “characterizing art-horror solely on the basis of our own subjective responses”, pointing to horror as a genre identified by how “the emotive responses of the audience run parallel to the emotions of the characters.”
        <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24475369">Sauchelli</a> adds an atmospheric definition to the horror genre, providing unifying features of aesthetics and mood and stating that horror is “not defined by a specific emotional reaction to a monster, but rather by a diffuse atmosphere that permeates the work”, the atmosphere being a “state of continuous tension and expectations related to a connection of the atmospheric details with terrifying and unpleasant issues.” This similarly draws a narrow picture of the genre, leaving lighter and stranger modes of horror out of the definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r25fz">Powell</a> uses Deleuzian concepts to define the nature of horror, finding its center in physicality, and states that “horror films work the vibrations of sensory affect on our jarred and confused optic and aural nerves…operate through our haptic projections of sensations such as tactility, simulated and engendered by visual and aural techniques…[and evoke] some peripheral sensations of taste and smell…through cinematography and sound.” In this idea, once again as in Sauchelli and Carroll, horror’s identifiable genre attributes are situated as strategies to engender particular affective responses in its audiences, a concept that I work with in pursuing pattern-based textual/visual analysis of filmic techniques and their expression in the chosen examples to demonstrate cozy horror subgenre membership.

      <h2>On Coziness and Cozy Media</h2>
      <p>Coziness in this paper means work that provokes an affective response of calm, warmth, pleasantness, care, and comfort. This is, in fact, what coziness means at large, though it varies in usage
        <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/coziness">Cambridge dictionary</a> defines it as “the quality of being comfortable, pleasant, and warm”. 
        <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755458613001151">Bille</a> frames lighting’s role in the development of coziness (or hygge) in Danish neighborhoods, stating that “to be in a situation characterized by hygge is to be in a state of pleasant well-being and security, with a relaxed frame of mind and open enjoyment of the immediate situation in all its small pleasures.” This definition of coziness supports the seeking of shared characteristics that allow media to be cozy - what makes media cozy? And in particular, horror media?
      </p>
      <p>Though to some the use of coziness conceptually here may strike as a sentiment antithetical to the purpose of horror (including to several of the horror studies scholars that I cited above), the idea of horror film as a comforting or cozy experience is not entirely new. Fangoria magazine, a premiere journalistic enterprise for horror fans, has articles available online right now on the matter, listicles describing
        <a href="https://www.fangoria.com/10-cozy-horror-movies/">"10 Cozy Horror Movies"</a> and <a href="https://www.fangoria.com/10-fright-night-films-people-find-comfort-in-rewatching/">"10 Fright Night Films People Find Comfort in Rewatching"</a>.
        Here, cozy horror is described as “movies, games, or shows that send the familiar…fear…but simultaneously feel like a big warm hug, the perfect balm for rainy days and tummy aches”. The first article is populated by deeply stratified and diverse films, demonstrating how much personal taste might come into play. Future work on this topic might investigate these films in relation to the characteristics map developed through this study (see “Visualization” section). The second article offers a potential answer for the why of cozy horror, adding that “since they are horror fans and scary movies are one of their favorite things, it makes sense that they would go to their favorite horrifying films for that kind of respite from the world’s troubles”. 
      </p>
      <p>This is supported by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15554120241310920">Krzywinksa et. al.</a> as they observe relationships of player to text in cozy gaming, indicating that “horror games can…feel like home to a player who knows and enjoys the patternings of control and chaos they offer”, players who are familiar with the tropes and conventions of that type of game.
        <a href="https://czasopisma.uni.lodz.pl/Replay/article/view/23171">Waszkiewicz</a> similarly considers how horror and adjacent topics might fit into the cozy gaming genre, using the term “dark cozy” to consider these games’ ability to evoke feelings of safety and coziness in their players. This article likewise considers how “ludic and visual safety seem to be the necessary conditions for the game to still be classified as cozy, with the lack of narrative safety allowing for the existence of other subtypes to be recognized within cozy games.”
        <a href="https://brill.com/display/book/9789401204811/B9789401204811-s015.xml">Brzozowska-Brywczy</a> identifies overlaps of monstrousness and cuteness in both directions, identifying cute monsters and monstrous cuties in terms of aesthetic variation from the “norm”. The piece offers the idea that cuteness can moralize the monstrous, neutralizing negative social effects.
        <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1754073911402396">Sherman and Haidt</a> similarly consider the humanizing effects of cuteness and disgust as emotional reactions and social factors, and discuss how the disparate emotions lead to dehumanizing and anthropomorphizing - “Disgust and the cuteness response–by modulating social impulses in opposing directions–aid in the optimization of social relationships”. 
      </p>
      <p>While cuteness is not indeed the topic of this research, this article supports the idea that other emotional responses that are similar affectively (like those mentioned here such as “love, gratitude, and moral elevation”) could demonstrably alter perceptions of horror media, making it familiar and, for our understanding, cozy.

    <section id="the-meat-textual-analysis" class="text-section">
      <h2>The Meat: Textual Analysis</h2>
      <p>I underwent a visual/textual analysis of the chosen example artefacts, based on the criteria stated below, to develop my argument for shared aesthetic and narrative characteristics that constitute inclusion in the cozy horror genre. Analysis occurred through visual observation of each text while taking detailed notes about each criteria, and subsequently coding these results in terms/phrases that I identified from my notes as shared traits/language. For example, “antagonist disguised as friend, revealed, and reversal” in OTGW (Over the Garden Wall) and “reversal of friend/antagonist roles” in SH (Sleepy Hollow) were turned into the code “Friend and Foe Reveal” in the process. The categories of “VFX” and “Icons and Symbolism” proved too disparate across style and medium to compare reasonably - they seem more specific to the story than the archetypes and forms the story is borrowing from and to the formal characteristics of the style of media (i.e. animation vs big budget live action vs independent live action, etc.) than to horror as a monolithic genre. This leads me to the conclusion that these would be more mobile and individuated characteristics across movies/media in the cozy horror subgenre. 
      </p>
      <p>My textual analysis through visual observation considered the following categories: 1) Thematic features - Story Type; Monster Type/Presence; Themes; Characters and Relationships; Stakes and 2) Aesthetic features - Color; Icons and Symbolism; Lighting; Sound; Visual Effects (VFX); Pace. These categories identify aspects of each media work that encompass their strategies for provoking affective responses in audiences.        
      </p>
      <p>In addition to my manual analysis as a media scholar, I also used computational methods to gather quantitative data on the visual traits of each example. With coding assistance from <a href="https://openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, I created a series of <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> scripts to run in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a> that analyzed the film files of each example (the three movies and the 10 episodes of OTGW as a unit) to extrapolate the average shot length and the dominant color palettes of each work. While the shot length did not yield many conclusions, the color analysis was useful. I produced through this method “barcodes” of each work, which condense every 10 frames of the artefact into one palette-revealing barcode-style image. These assist in providing visual clarity to my analysis of what puts these media in conversation with one another in the cozy horror subgenre. 
      </p>
      <p>The intention of this study is not to to deep dive into each text and write up how they exemplify the cozy horror genre, but to, identifying these films as “cozy”, see trends in their presentation thematically, aesthetically, and through those attributes, affectively, that situate them together in a genre. I sought through this research patterns of characteristics in horror media that produces a cozy feeling, which as mentioned earlier, is subjective, in the hopes of creating a repeatable network of shared characteristics with which to evaluate additional media for its perceived inclusion in the cozy horror subgenre. As such, I will present the data below not organized by individual example, but as a whole to emphasize the importance in this study on patterns. I will offer individualized clips of each media example to introduce their mood and share the barcodes before sharing the compiled visual analysis data that led me to the holistic graphs in the following section.

      <h2>Visualizing Cozy Characteristics</h2>
      <p>	With the identified shared characteristics above, I created a few visualizations to demonstrate the connections between traits and attributes of the cozy horror examples. These visualizations were created by formatting and uploading my data (above) into Flourish and adjusting settings for visual clarity. The overlap in characteristics both thematic and aesthetic offer a picture of what might make a piece of horror media cozy. By finding the patterns in observable cozy horror media, this study identifies genre traits that might be used to evaluate and include additional work in the Cozy Horror ‘canon’.

      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>After identifying these patterns, I am considering future applications and directions of this work. Most obvious to me is the connection between a rising popularity in horror films, an emerging academic area of study in cozy media (particularly cozy games), and how these leaps in popularity might speak to contemporary affective needs. I believe this is outside of the scope of this particular paper, but there is much to be said on the topic of modern affective response and technology with regards to cozy horror’s rise. Also outside of the scope is the concept of “comfort horror”, which I flirted with a few times in this research. Comfort horror seems to me deeply related to cozy horror, though not involving a full overlap, in the focus on audience affective response. 
      </p>
      <p>Future directions for this work might include additional consideration of sociopolitical factors contributing to interest in cozy horror and cozy media in general; contrasting comfort horror, horror comedy, and cozy horror; a consideration of other mediums that employ cozy horror - artefacts to be analyzed might include the video game
        <a href="https://www.cultofthelamb.com/"><i>Cult of the Lamb</i></a>, the podcast <a href="https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/"><i>The Adventure Zone</i></a>, and the board game <a href="https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US/products/games/family-games/horrified-universal-monsters-60001836"><i>Horrified</i></a>; and considering the role of nostalgia in developing personal comfort and cozy horror tastes and repertoires.
